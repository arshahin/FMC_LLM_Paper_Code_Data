Based on the given sentence, the failure mode can be classified as an electrical failure. The phrase "runs for a while and trip" suggests that something is running, possibly an electrical device or system, but then it suddenly trips or shuts off. This could indicate a fault in the electrical circuit, such as a short circuit or overload, causing the system to trip and stop running.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0
